In Brief Explanation of my project, 

Mananging inventory is challange for the businesses, they are requires to track of available items and able to identify which items sold out, if they're unable to identify it would be extremely disorganized and it would near impossible to track the items, so with the coding, it can provide the inventory menu, it allows you to see what items you have in stock, you can add items, sell items and update the inventory and log out. It helps keep everything organized.
